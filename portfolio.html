    <h1>   During this project we have learned collaboration, which will help in almost any career that involves coworkers or talking to others. We also learned critical thinking/problem solving. When you canâ€™t figure something out while working, it requires critical thinking to solve the problem. Lastly, we learned how to plan our course of action. In any career, it is always good to follow a set plan in order to finish work in an organized and efficient manner.
